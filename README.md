# Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network (No correct checked by cxx)
Pytorch implementation of Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network for Text Classification.

## Note
This is a simple pytorch implmentation of dynamic convolutional neural network as presented in the paper 
A Convolutional Neural Network for Modelling Sentences by Kalchbrenner et al. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2188v1) for
DCNN.
